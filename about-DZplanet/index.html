		<p id="text" data-aos="fade-right" ><span class="h1">Why Algeria?</span><br>Algeria is one of the most interesting countries in North Africa and one of the friendliest. Yet, it remains an unknown destination. Pristine Sahara, gorgeous coastline, beautiful cultural sites, bustling cities, and mouth-watering food, it is also a country with geographical contrasts, with great differences, from the green valleys in between steep mountains in the north to some of the most extensive sand dune regions of all Sahara.Algeria is the place to visit if you want to get off the beaten track.</p>
